# Newsletter_Project

# Introduction:

Schools frequently communicate with their staff and students through various means, such as email announcements. These announcements can contain essential information about school events, deadlines, policy changes, and other matters that are critical to the school community.
In this project, we aim to analyze a dataset containing information about school announcements made by staff and faculty members. The dataset includes various columns such as title, body, signature, submission time, and category. The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the category of each announcement based on its title and body.

The categorization of announcements can provide valuable insights into the types of messages that are most commonly communicated by the school staff. By analyzing the frequency of each category, school administrators can identify areas that require more attention and focus. For example, if a significant number of announcements fall under the "policy changes" category, administrators may need to review their policies and procedures to ensure that they are clear and up to date.

Furthermore, the frequency with which announcements are issued can also provide valuable information. An excessive number of announcements can lead to information overload and make it difficult for staff and students to prioritize important messages. On the other hand, a lack of announcements can result in important information being overlooked. Therefore, by analyzing the frequency of announcements, administrators can optimize their communication strategy and ensure that they are providing the right amount of information to the school community.

Overall, the objective of this project is to provide insights into the types and frequency of school announcements. This information can be used to improve communication strategies and ensure that important information is effectively conveyed to the school community.

# Data Understanding:

The first step in any data analysis project is to understand the data that we are working with. The dataset that we are working with is a newsletter dataset, which contains various announcements and updates from a school or university. The dataset has the following columns:
